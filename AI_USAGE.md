# AI Usage

Using AI in daily work has become common. In this project i used **Colipot, ChatGPT & Stitch** were used to speed up coding, debugging, and writing documentation. Every Line of code is carefully read, unterstood & tested before considering it to commit and raise PR.

### Coding

- used copilot and chatGpt to generate boiler plates.
- Understanding few unknown concepts like resizing the image.
- Generating the JSX which usually takes lot of time.
- Generating test case boiler plates.

### Debugging

- My prettier & eslint where giving hard time so used chatGPT to locate exact issue.
- if you see my pr [17](https://github.com/ashish328/ai-studio/pull/17) i fixed multiple calls for image which is already load using chatGTP by understanding `URL.createObjectURL`.

### UI/UX Design

- generated UI designs of the entire app using stitch
